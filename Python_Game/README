# Othello Game

This repository contains the implementation of the classic board game Othello (also known as Reversi). The game allows two players (human vs. human or human vs. computer) to play against each other on an 8x8 board.

## How to Play

The game starts with an initial configuration of the board with four discs in the center:
- Black (1) at positions (3, 3) and (4, 4)
- White (2) at positions (3, 4) and (4, 3)

Players take turns placing their discs on the board, with the objective of flipping their opponent's discs. The game ends when neither player can make a valid move, and the player with the most discs on the board wins.

## Features

- Human vs. Human mode
- Human vs. Computer mode
- Dynamic board display
- Score calculation
