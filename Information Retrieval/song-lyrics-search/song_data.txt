Lyrics:
[Verse 1] Step back and watch the sweet thing Breaking everything she sees She can take my darkest feeling Tear it up till I'm on my knees Plug into her electric cool Where things bend and break and shake to the rule Talking fast couldn't tell me something I would shed my skin for you Talking fast on the edge of nothing I would break my back for you Don't know why, don't know why Things vaporise and rise to the sky 
[Chorus 1] And we tried so hard And we looked so good And we lived our lives in black But something about you felt like pain You were my sunny day rain You were the clouds in the sky You were the darkest sky But your lips spoke gold and honey And that's why I'm happy when it rains I'm happy when it pours

[Bridge] Look at me enjoying something That feels like, feels like pain To my brain 
[Verse 2] And if I tell you something You take me back to nothing I'm on the edge of something You take me back 
[Chorus 2] And I'm happy when it rains And I'm happy when it rains And I'm happy now And I'm happy when it rains 
[Outro] And I'm happy now And I'm happy when it rains And I'm happy now Oh, I'm happy now Oh, I'm happy when it rains

Lyrics:
[Verse 1] It's four in the morning, the end of December I'm writing you now just to see if you're better New York is cold, but I like where I'm living There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening I hear that you're building Your little house deep in the desert You're living for nothing now I hope you're keeping some kind of record 
[Chorus] Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair She said that you gave it to her That night that you planned to go clear Did you ever go clear? 
[Verse 2] Oh, the last time we saw you you looked so much older Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder You'd been to the station to meet every train But then you came home without Lili Marlene And you treated my woman To a flake of your life And when she came back She was nobody's wife

[Chorus 2] Well, I see you there with the rose in your teeth One more thin gypsy thief Well I see Jane's awake She sends her regard 
[Verse 3] And what can I tell you my brother, my killer? What can I possibly say? I guess that I miss you. I guess I forgive you I'm glad you stood in my way If you ever come by here For Jane or for me Well, your enemy is sleeping And his woman is free 
[Chorus] Yes, and thanks for the trouble You took from her eyes I thought it was there for good So I never tried And Jane came by with a lock of your hair She said that you gave it to her That night that you planned to go clear Sincerely, L. Cohen

[Chorus 2] Take one for the team, you're a cog in the machine It's like a default 
[Refrain] –Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault –Fault, like-like-like, de-default –Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault –Fault, like-like-like, de-default –Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault –Fault, like-like-like, de-default –Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault –Fault, like-like-like, de-default 
[Chorus 2] Take one for the team, you're a cog in the machine It's like a default 
[Verse 2] You've missed the starting gun for everything you've ever done You took part in the race but disappeared without a trace You thought you'd set the bar, I never tried to work it out We just lit the fire and now you want to put it out 
[Chorus 3] Forget about the cause, press rewind, then stop and pause It's like a default

[Refrain] –Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault –Fault, like-like-like, de-default –Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault –Fault, like-like-like, de-default –Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault –Fault, like-like-like, de-default –Fault, like-like-like, de-default, –fault –Fault, like-like-like, de-default

[Verse 1] This is the first day of my life Swear I was born right in the doorway I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed They're spreading blankets on the beach Yours is the first face that I saw I think I was blind before I met you Now I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've been But I know where I want to go 
[Chorus] And so I thought I'd let you know Yeah, these things take forever, I especially am slow But I realize that I need you And I wondered if I could come home Mhm, mhm 
[Verse 2] Remember the time you drove all night Just to meet me in the morning? And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed You felt as if you'd just woke up And you said, "This is the first day of my life I'm glad I didn't die before I met you But now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you And I'd probably be happy"

[Chorus] So if you wanna be with me With these things there's no telling, we just have to wait and see But I'd rather be working for a paycheck than waiting to win the lottery Aha, mhm Besides, maybe this time it's different I mean, I really think you like me

[Verse 1] So I'm back, to the velvet underground Back to the floor, that I love To a room with some lace and paper flowers Back to the gypsy that I was To the gypsy that I was

[Bridge] To the gypsy that remains Faces freedom with a little fear I have no fear, I have only love And if I was a child And the child was enough Enough for me to love Enough to love 
[Verse 3] She is dancing away from me now She was just a wish She was just a wish And a memory is all that is left for you now You see your gypsy, oh You see your gypsy

[Outro] Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice And it all comes down to you And it all comes down to you Lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice And it all comes down to you And it all comes down to you I still see your bright eyes, bright eyes And it all comes down to you

Lyrics:
[Verse 1] I was raised up believing I was somehow unique Like a snowflake distinct among snowflakes Unique in each way you'd conceive And now after some thinking, I'd say I'd rather be A functioning cog in some great machinery Serving something beyond me But I don't, I don't know what that will be I'll get back to you someday soon, you will see 
[Verse 2] What's my name, what's my station Oh, just tell me what I should do I don't need to be kind to the armies of night That would do such injustice to you Or bow down and be grateful and say "Sure, take all that you see" To the men who move only in dimly lit halls and determine my future for me And I don't, I don't know who to believe I'll get back to you someday soon, you will see 
[Verse 3] If I know only one thing, it's that everything that I see Of the world outside is so inconceivable Often, I barely can speak Yeah, I'm tongue-tied and dizzy And I can't keep it to myself What good is it to sing helplessness blues? Why should I wait for anyone else? And I know, I know you will keep me on the shelf I'll come back to you someday soon myself

[Outro] If I had an orchard, I'd work till I'm raw If I had an orchard, I'd work till I'm sore And you would wait tables and soon run the store Gold hair in the sunlight, my light in the dawn If I had an orchard, I'd work till I'm sore If I had an orchard, I'd work till I'm sore And someday I'll be like the man on the screen

[Chorus: Bobby Kimball] It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do I bless the rains down in Africa Gonna take some time to do the things we never had (Ooh) 
[Verse 2: David Paich] The wild dogs cry out in the night As they grow restless longing for some solitary company I know that I must do what's right As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti I seek to cure what's deep inside Frightened of this thing that I've become 
[Chorus: Bobby Kimball] It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do I bless the rains down in Africa Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Bridge: David Paich & Bobby Kimball] Hurry, boy, she's waiting there for you 
[Chorus: Bobby Kimball] It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do I bless the rains down in Africa I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains) I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rains) I bless the rains down in Africa I bless the rains down in Africa (Gonna take the time) Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

[Chorus] But I will hold on hope And I won't let you choke On the noose around your neck And I'll find strength in pain And I will change my ways I'll know my name as it's called again 
[Verse 2] 'Cause I have other things to fill my time You take what is yours and I'll take mine Now let me at the truth Which will refresh my broken mind So tie me to a post and block my ears I can see widows and orphans through my tears I know my call despite my faults And despite my growing fears

[Chorus] But I will hold on hope And I won't let you choke On the noose around your neck And I'll find strength in pain And I will change my ways I'll know my name as it's called again 
[Verse 3] So come out of your cave walking on your hands And see the world hanging upside down You can understand dependence When you know the maker's land 
[Chorus 2] So make your siren's call And sing all you want I will not hear what you have to say 'Cause I need freedom now And I need to know how To live my life as it's meant to be 
[Chorus/Outro] And I will hold on hope And I won't let you choke On the noose around your neck And I'll find strength in pain And I will change my ways I'll know my name as it's called again

Standing there alone The ship is waiting All systems are go Are you sure? Control is not convinced But the computer Has the evidence "No need to abort" The countdown starts Watching in a trance The crew is certain Nothing left to chance All is working Trying to relax Up in the capsule "Send me up a drink" Jokes Major Tom The count goes on 4 3 2 1 Earth below us Drifting, falling Floating, weightless Calling, calling home...
Second stage is cut We're now in orbit Stabilizers up Running perfect Starting to collect Requested data "What will it effect When all is done?" Thinks Major Tom Back at ground control There is a problem Go to rockets full Not responding "Hello, Major Tom Are you receiving? Turn the thrusters on We're standing by" There's no reply 4 3 2 1 Earth below us Drifting, falling Floating, weightless Calling, calling home...
Across the stratosphere A final message "Give my wife my love" Then nothing more Far beneath the ship The world is mourning They don't realize He's alive No one understands But Major Tom sees Now the life commands This is my home I'm coming home Earth below us Drifting, falling Floating, weightless Calling home... Earth below us Drifting, falling Floating, weightless Calling home... Earth below us Drifting, falling Floating, weightless Calling, calling home... Home.....

Release Date: 2006
Lyrics:
[Verse 1] I swear that you don't have to go I thought we could wait for the fireworks I thought we could wait for the snow To wash over Georgia and kill the hurt I thought I could live in your arms And spend every moment I had with you Stay up all night with the stars Confess all the faith that I had in you (I had in you) 
[Pre-Chorus] Too late, I'm sure and lonely Another night, another dream wasted on you Just be here now against me You know the words, so sing along for me, baby 
[Chorus] For heaven's sake I know you're sorry But you won't stop crying This anniversary may never be the same Inside I hope you know I'm dying With my heart beside me In shattered pieces that may never be replaced And if I died right now you'd never be the same 
[Verse 2] I thought with a month of apart Together would find us an opening And moonlight would provide the spark And that I would stumble across the key Or break down the door to your heart Forever could see us - not you and me And you'd help me out of the dark And I'd give my heart as an offering (an offering)

[Pre-Chorus] Too late, I'm sure and lonely Another night, another dream wasted on you Just be here now against me You know the words, so sing along for me, baby 
[Chorus] For heaven's sake I know you're sorry But you won't stop crying This anniversary may never be the same Inside I hope you know I'm dying With my heart beside me In shattered pieces that may never be replaced And if I died right now you'd never be the same And I will always remember you as you are right now to me And I will always remember you now, remember you now So sleep alone tonight, with no one here just by your side Sleep alone tonight How does he feel, how does he kiss? (Let's sleep alone tonight) How does he taste while he's on your lips? (With no one here just by your side) How does he feel, how does he kiss? (Sleep alone tonight)
How does he feel, how does he kiss? (Let's sleep alone tonight) How does he taste while he's on your lips? (With no one here just by your side) How does he feel, how does he kiss? (Sleep alone tonight) How does he feel, how does he kiss? (Let's sleep alone tonight) How does he taste while he's on your lips? (With no one here just by your side) How does he feel, how does he kiss? (Sleep alone tonight) I can't forget you (Let's sleep alone tonight) I know you want me to want you, I want to (With no one here just by your side) But I can't forget you (Sleep alone tonight) So when this is over don't blow your composure, baby I can't forget you (Let's sleep alone tonight) I know you want me to want you, I want to (With no one here just by your side) But I can't forget you (Sleep alone tonight) So when this is over don't blow your composure
I can't forget you I know you want me to want you, I want to

Album: So Long, Astoria
Release Date: 2003-03-04
Lyrics:
[Verse 1] It was the first snow of the season, I can almost see you breathing In the middle of that empty street Sometimes I still see myself in that lonesome bedroom Playing my guitar and singing songs of hope for a better future 
[Chorus] Life is only as good as the memories we make And I'm taking back what belongs to me Polaroids of classrooms unattended These relics of remembrance are just like shipwrecks Only they're gone faster than the smell after it rains 
[Verse 2] Last night while everyone was sleeping, I drove through my old neighborhood And resurrected memories from ashes We said that we would never fit in when we were really just like them Does rebellion ever make a difference? 
[Chorus] Life is only as good as the memories we make And I'm taking back what belongs to me Polaroids of classrooms unattended These relics of remembrance are just like shipwrecks Only they're gone faster than the smell after it rains

[Bridge] So long, Astoria, I found a map to buried treasure And even if we come home empty handed We'll still have our stories of battle scars Pirate ships and wounded hearts Broken bones and all the best of friendships And when this hourglass has filtered out its final grain of sand I raise my glass to the memories we had 
[Outro] This is my wish and I'm taking it back I'm taking them all back

[Chorus] Leave me Lying here 'Cause I don't wanna go Leave me Lying here 'Cause I don't wanna go

[Verse 2] A million miles of running and I hit the wall I bounce back and I run some more But this is it, I'm giving up, I'm calling quits So get down and meet me on the floor Way to go, way to flip off everyone I steal your thunder then I try to bolt But I could stand a little pity now and then I'm falling off, I am watered down and fully grown 
[Bridge] Go, I don't wanna Go, I don't wanna Go, I don't wanna Go, I don't wanna go I told you 'bout the seether before You know, the one that's neither or nor Well, here's another clue if you please The seether's Louise One, two, three, whoa

[Chorus] See you at the bitter end See you at the bitter end 
[Verse 2] Every step we take that's synchronized Every broken bone Reminds me of the second time That I followed you home You shower me with lullabies As you're walking away Reminds me that it's killing time On this fateful day 
[Chorus] See you at the bitter end See you at the bitter end See you at the bitter end See you at the bitter end

[Outro] From the time we intercepted Feels a lot like suicide Slow and sad, grown inside us Arouse and see you're mine (See you at the bitter end) Love has seen your run-around Who wanna seek you now? I want a peace I'd whine out (See you at the bitter end) Love's reached his side Grab this gentleness inside Heard a cry Six feet down (See you at the bitter end) In six weeks' time The mess you left Will end

[Intro] 
[Verse] So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain? Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell? Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage? 
[Acoustic Guitar Solo] 
[Chorus] How I wish, how I wish you were here We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year Running over the same old ground, what have we found? The same old fears, wish you were here

Lyrics:
[Verse 1] I think I'm in love with the girl next door It's driving me crazy, I can't take it anymore I hear her playing the drums late at night The neighbours complain, but that's the kind of girl I like 
[Pre-Chorus] And maybe I should call her up and invite her around Or maybe I should move to another town But when I hear those drums late at night I know I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) 
[Chorus] I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) I think I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus] And maybe I should say "What's up?" and invite her around Or take her for a spin around the town 'Cause when I hear those drums late at night I know I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down)

[Chorus] I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love (Two doors down) I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love (Two doors down) I think I'm in love with a girl who lives 
[Pre-Chorus] And maybe I should call her up and invite her around And, one day, we could move to another town 'Cause when I hear those drums late at night I know I'm in love, in love with a girl who lives 
[Chorus] I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love (Two doors down) I think I'm in love with a girl who lives (Two doors down) I think I'm in love, I think I'm in love (Two doors down) I think I'm in love with a girl who lives

Lyrics:
[Verse 1: Gary Lightbody & Martha Wainwright] I find the map and draw a straight line Over rivers, farms, and state lines The distance from "A" to where you'd be It's only finger-lengths that I see 
[Pre-Chorus 1: Gary Lightbody & Martha Wainwright] I touch the place Where I'd find your face My fingers in creases Of distant dark places 
[Verse 2: Gary Lightbody & Martha Wainwright] I hang my coat up in the first bar There is no peace that I've found so far The laughter penetrates my silence As drunken men find flaws in science 
[Pre-Chorus 2: Gary Lightbody & Martha Wainwright] Their words, mostly noises Ghosts with just voices Your words in my memory Are like music to me 
[Chorus: Gary Lightbody & Martha Wainwright] And miles from where you are I lay down on the cold ground, I I pray that somethin' picks me up And sets me down in your warm arms

[Verse 3: Gary Lightbody & Martha Wainwright] After I have travelled so far We'd set the fire to the third bar We'd share each other like an island Until exhausted, close our eyelids 
[Pre-Chorus 3: Gary Lightbody & Martha Wainwright] And dreaming, pick up from The last place we left off Your soft skin is weepin' A joy you can't keep in 
[Chorus: Gary Lightbody & Martha Wainwright] And miles from where you are I lay down on the cold ground and I I pray that somethin' picks me up And sets me down in your warm arms And miles from where you are I lay down on the cold ground and I I pray that somethin' picks me up And sets me down in your warm arms

[Chorus] Every me and every you Every me... Every me and every you Every me... 
[Verse 4] Like the naked leads the blind I know I'm selfish, I'm unkind Sucker love I always find Someone to bruise and leave behind All alone in space and time There's nothing here but what here's mine Something borrowed, something blue Every me and every you 
[Chorus] Every me and every you Every me... Every me and every you Every me... Every me and every you Every me... Every me and every you Every me... Every me and every you Every me... Every me and every you Every me...

[Verse 1] She says she's no good With words, but I'm worse Barely stuttered out a joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue Weighed down with words too Overdramatic Tonight, it's "it can't get much worse" Versus "No one should ever feel like..." 
[Pre-Chorus] I'm two quarters and a heart down And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds These words are all I have so I write them So you need them just to get by (...emal si namhorT eoJ)

[Pre-Chorus] I'm two quarters and a heart down And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds These words are all I have so I write them So you need them just to get by

[Bridge] Why don't you show me the little bit of spine You've been saving for his mattress (Mattress, mattress) I only want sympathy in the form of you Crawling into bed with me 
[Chorus] Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half-time Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead Dance, this is the way they'd love (Way they'd love) Dance, this is the way they'd love me (Way they'd love) Dance, this is the way they'd love If they knew how misery loved me...

Lyrics:
[Verse 1] Yeah, but nobody searches Nobody cares somehow When the loving that you've wasted Comes raining from a hapless cloud And I might stop and look upon your face Disappear in the sweet, sweet gaze See the living that surrounds me Dissipate in a violet place 
[Pre-Chorus] Can't you see what you've done to my heart And soul? This is a wasteland now 
[Chorus] We spies We slow hands Put the weights around yourself We spies Oh yeah, we slow hands You put the weights all around yourself Now 
[Verse 2] I submit, my incentive is romance I watched the pole dance of the stars We rejoice because the hurting is so painless From the distance of passing cars But I am married to your charms and grace I just go crazy like the good old days You make me want to pick up a guitar And celebrate the myriad ways that I love you

[Pre-Chorus] Can't you see what you've done to my heart And soul? This is a wasteland now 
[Chorus] We spies Yeah, we slow hands Put the weights around yourself We spies Oh, yeah, we slow hands Killer for hire, you know not yourself 
[Chorus] We spies We slow hands You put the weights all around yourself We spies Oh, yeah, we slow hands We retire like nobody else We spies Intimate slow hands Killer for hire, you know not yourself We spies Intimate slow hands You let the face slap around herself

[Intro] Steady 
[Verse 1] Before this world starts up again It's me and night We wait for the sun The kids and drunks head back inside Well, there's lots of smart ideas in books I've never read When the girls come talk to me, I wish to hell I had 
[Pre-Chorus] (Get up, get up) Turn the ignition (Get up, get up) Fire up the system Play my little part in something big 
[Chorus] I'll accept with poise, with grace When they draw my name from the lottery And they'll say, "All the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice." I'm the one who gets away I'm a New Jersey success story And they'll say, "Lord, give me a chance to shake that hand." (They'll say) 
[Verse 2] Back when I was younger, I was someone you'd've liked Got an old guitar I've had for years I'd let you buy And I'll tell you something else that you ain't dying enough to know There's still some living left when your prime comes and goes

[Pre-Chorus] (Get up, get up) Dance on the ceiling (Get up, get up) Boy, you must be dreaming Rock on young saviour, don't give up your hopes 
[Chorus] I'll accept with poise, with grace When they draw my name from the lottery And they'll say, "All the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice." I'm the one who gets away I'm a New Jersey success story And they'll say, "Lord, give me a chance to shake that hand." 
[Bridge] I have one last wish And it's from my heart Just let me down Just let me down, easy 
[Chorus] I'll accept with poise, with grace When they draw my name from the lottery And they'll say, "All the salt in the world couldn't melt that ice." I'm the one who gets away I'm a New Jersey success story And they'll say, "Lord, give me a chance to shake his hand." (They'll say)

Release Date: 2009-08-25
Lyrics:
[Verse 1] Outside the cafe by the cracker factory You were practicing a magic trick And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed On the last of your pick and mix Said, "You're mistaken if you're thinking That I haven't been called cold before" As you bit into your strawberry lace And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper It's all you had left and it was going to waste 
[Chorus] Your pastimes consisted of the strange And twisted and deranged And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man On rainy afternoons 
[Verse 2] The next time that I caught my own reflection It was on its way to meet you Thinking of excuses to postpone You never looked like yourself from the side But your profile could not hide The fact you knew I was approaching your throne With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

[Chorus] And your pastimes consisted of the strange And twisted and deranged And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are Crying Lightning 
[Instrumental Break] 
[Chorus] Your pastimes consisted of the strange And twisted and deranged And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning Your pastimes consisted of the strange And twisted and deranged And I hate that little game you had called Crying

Kiss of Life! Rub that line out of the sand, I can feel it closer Closer than I’ll never be Rub that line out of the sand, I know you think it’s over Staring out into the sea Don’t let go! This could be so perfect Don’t let go! If we hold onto it Rub that line out of the sand, right before the tide comes Washes you away from me Oohwhoo.. Kiss of Life! Oohwhoo.. Kiss of Life! Could you wave goodbye to sun, the sea, the stars, the waves, the tide? The wills inside that life has died but all you need is a Kiss of Life! Rub that light out of the sky, I can feel the night crawl Of broken drums and tambourines Rub that light out of the sky, I can see the clouds form Taking shape in front of me Don’t let go! This could be so easy Don’t let go! If you hold on to me
Rub that lite out of the sky, right before the sun falls Kiss of Life! Oohwhoo.. Kiss of Life! Oohwhoo.. Kiss of Life! Could you wave goodbye to sun, the sea, the stars, the waves, the tide? The wills inside that life has died but all you need is a Kiss of Life! Could you wave goodbye to sun, the sea, the stars, the waves, the tide? The wills inside that life has died but all you need is a Kiss of Life! Oohwhoo.. Kiss of Life! Oohwhoo.. Kiss of Life! Oohwhoo.. Kiss of Life! Oohwhoo.. Kiss of Life!

Album: Where The Humans Eat
Release Date: 2004
Lyrics:
I wanna be better than oxygen So you can breathe when you're drowning and weak in the knees I wanna speak louder than Ritalin For all the children who think that they've got a disease I wanna be cooler than TV For all the kids that are wondering what they're going to be We can be stronger than bombs If you're singing along and you know that you really believe We can be richer than industry As long as we know that there's things that we don't really need We can speak louder than ignorance Cause we speak in silence every time our eyes meet On and on and on it goes The world it just keeps spinning Until I'm dizzy, time to breathe So close my eyes and start again anew I wanna see through all the lies of society To the reality, happiness is at stake I wanna hold up my head with dignity Proud of a life where to give means more than to take I wanna live beyond the modern mentality Where paper is all that you're really taught to create Do you remember the forgotten America? Justice, equality, freedom to every race? Just need to get past all the lies and hypocrisy Makeup and hair to the truth behind every face Then look around to all the people you see How many of them are happy and free? I know it sounds like a dream But it's the only thing that can get me to sleep at night I know it's hard to believe But it's easy to see that something here isn't right I know the future looks dark But it's there that the kids of today must carry the light
On and on and on it goes The world it just keeps spinning Until I'm dizzy, time to breathe So close my eyes and start again anew If I'm afraid to catch a dream I'll weave your baskets and I'll float them down the river stream Each one I weave with words I speak To carry love to your relief I wanna be better than oxygen So you can breathe when you're drowning and weak in the knees I wanna speak louder than Ritalin For all the children who think that they've got a disease I wanna be cooler than TV For all the kids that are wondering what they're going to be We can be stronger than bombs If you're singing along and you know that you really believe We can be richer than industry As long as we know that there's things that we don't really need We can speak louder than ignorance Cause we speak in silence every time our eyes meet On and on and on it goes The world it just keeps spinning Until I'm dizzy, time to breathe So close my eyes and start again anew

[Chorus] I try and walk in a straight line An imitation of dignity From despair to where From despair to where 
[Verse 2] Outside open mouthed crowds Pass each other as if they're drugged Down pale corridors of routine Where life falls unatoned The weak kick like straw Till the world means less and less Words are never enough Just cheap tarnished glitter

[Chorus] I try and walk in a straight line An imitation of dignity From despair to where From despair to where 
[Chorus] A cripple walks in a straight line An imitation of dignity From despair to where From despair to where

Please don't go crazy if I tell you the truth No, you don't know what happened and you never will If you don't listen to me while I talk to the wall This blanket is freezing, it's been out in the hall Where you've had me for hours 'til I'm sure what I want But darling, I want the same thing that I wanted before So sweetheart, tell me what's up, I won't stop No way Please keep your hands down, and stop raising your voice It's hardly what I'd be doing if you gave me a choice It's a simple suggestion, can you give me some time? So just say yes or no, why can't you shoulder the blame? Cause both my shoulders are heavy from the weight of us both You're a big boy now, so let's not talk about growth You've not heard a single word I have said... Oh, my god Please take it easy it can't all be my fault I haven't made half the mistakes that you've listed so far Baby, let me explain something, it's all down to drugs At least I remember taking them and not a lot else It seems I've stepped over lines you've drawn again and again But if the ecstasy's in, the wit is definitely out Dr. Jekyll is wrestlin' Hyde for my pride

Artist: Survivor
Album: Rocky IV
Release Date: 1985
Lyrics:
[Verse 1] Rising up, back on the street Did my time, took my chances Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet Just a man and his will to survive So many times, it happens too fast You trade your passion for glory Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past You must fight just to keep them alive 
[Chorus] It's the eye of the tiger It's the thrill of the fight Rising up to the challenge of our rival And the last known survivor Stalks his prey in the night And he's watching us all With the eye of the tiger 
[Verse 2] Face to face, out in the heat Hanging tough, staying hungry They stack the odds 'til we take to the street For the kill with the skill to survive 
[Chorus] It's the eye of the tiger It's the thrill of the fight Rising up to the challenge of our rival And the last known survivor Stalks his prey in the night And he's watching us all With the eye of the tiger

[Verse 3] Rising up, straight to the top Had the guts, got the glory Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop Just a man and his will to survive 
[Chorus] It's the eye of the tiger It's the thrill of the fight Rising up to the challenge of our rival And the last known survivor Stalks his prey in the night And he's watching us all With the eye of the tiger 
[Outro] The eye of the tiger The eye of the tiger The eye of the tiger The eye of the tiger

[Verse 1] Come and hold my hand I wanna contact the living Not sure I understand This role I've been given I sit and talk to God And he just laughs at my plans My head speaks a language I don't understand 
[Chorus] I just wanna feel real love Feel the home that I live in 'Cause I got too much life Running through my veins Going to waste 
[Verse 2] I don't wanna die But I ain't keen on living either Before I fall in love I'm preparing to leave her Scare myself to death That's why I keep on running Before I've arrived I can see myself coming

[Instrumental Break] 
[Chorus] I just wanna feel real love Feel the home that I live in I got too much love Running through my veins To go to waste

Lyrics:
[Intro] Bust it 
[Verse 1] This here's a jam for all the fellas Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us Get shot down cause ya overzealous Play hard to get, females get jealous Okay smarty, go to a party Girls are scantily clad and showin' body A chick walks by, you wish you could sex her But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter Next day's function, high class luncheon Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin' Music comes on, people start to dance But then you ate so much, you nearly split your pants A girl starts walking, guys start gawking Sits down next to you and starts talking Says she wants to dance 'cause she likes to groove So come on, fatso and just bust a move Just bust a move Just bust a move Just bust a move 
[Verse 2] You're on a mission and you're wishin' Someone could cure your lonely condition Lookin' for love in all the wrong places No fine girls, just ugly faces From frustration, first inclination Is to become a monk and leave the situation But every dark tunnel has a light of hope So don't hang yourself with a celibate rope New movie's showin', so you're goin' Couldn't care less about the five you're blowin' Theater gets dark just to start the show Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row She's dressed in yellow, she says, "Hello Come sit next to me you fine fellow" You run over there without a second to lose And what comes next? Hey, bust a move

[Chorus] You want it You got it You want it Baby you got it (Just bust a move) You want it You got it You want it Baby you got it, yeah 
[Verse 3] In the city, ladies look pretty Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty Tell a funny joke just to get some play Then you try to make a move and she says, "No way" Girls are fakin', goodness sakin' They want a man who brings home the bacon Got no money and you got no car Then you got no woman and there you are Some girls are sadistic, materialistic Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic They're lyin' on the beach perpetrating a tan So that a brother with money can be their man So on the beach you're strollin', real high rollin' Everything you have is yours and not stolen A girl runs up with somethin' to prove So don't just stand there, bust a move

[Chorus] You want it You got it You want it Baby you got it (Just bust a move) You want it You got it You want it Baby you got it 
[Interlude] Break it down for me fellas 
[Verse 4] Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry In five days from now, he's gonna marry He's hopin' you can make it there if you can 'Cause in the ceremony, you'll be the best man You say, "neat-o", check your libido And roll to the church in your new tuxedo The bride walks down just to start the wedding And there's one more girl you won't be getting So you start thinkin', then you start blinking A bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking She thinks you're kinda cute, so she winks back And now your feelin' really firm 'cause the girl is stacked Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin' Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin' Says she wanna dance to a different groove Now you know what to do, G, bust a move

[Chorus] You want it You got it You want it Baby you got it (Just bust a move) You want it You got it You want it Baby you got it (move it boy) Yeah

Title: I Want You
Artist: Savage Garden
Album: Savage Garden
Release Date: 1997-03-04
Lyrics:
[Verse 1] Anytime I need to see your face, I just close my eyes And I am taken to a place where your crystal mind And magenta feelings take up shelter in the base of my spine Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola I don't need to try to explain; I just hold on tight And if it happens again, I might move so slightly To the arms and the lips and the face of the human cannonball That I need to, I want to 
[Pre-Chorus] Well, come stand a little bit closer Breathe in and get a bit higher You'll never know what hit you When I get to you 
[Chorus] Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but Ooh, I'd die to find out Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but Ooh, I would die to find out 
[Verse 2] I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment Getting comfy, getting perfect is what I live for But a look, then a smell of perfume It's like I'm down on the floor and I don't know what I'm in for Conversation has a time and place In the interaction of a lover and a mate But the time of talking, using symbols, using words Can be likened to a deep sea diver Who is swimming with a raincoat

[Pre-Chorus] Well, come stand a little bit closer Breathe in and get a bit higher You'll never know what hit you When I get to you 
[Chorus] Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but Ooh, I'd die to find out Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but Ooh, I would die to find out 
[Post-Chorus] (Ooh, ah) Yeah yeah (Ooh, ah) Yeah yeah 
[Verse 1] Anytime I need to see your face, I just close my eyes And I am taken to a place where your crystal mind And magenta feelings take up shelter in the base of my spine Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola I don't need to try to explain; I just hold on tight And if it happens again, I might move so slightly To the arms and the lips and the face of the human cannonball That I need to, I want to

Lyrics:
[Verse 1] Now that she's back in the atmosphere With drops of Jupiter in her hair She acts like summer and walks like rain Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey Since the return of her stay on the moon She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey Hey, hey-yeah 
[Chorus] But tell me, did you sail across the sun? Did you make it to the Milky Way To see the lights all faded And that heaven is overrated? And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star? One without a permanent scar And did you miss me while you were Looking for yourself out there? 
[Verse 2] Now that she's back from that soul vacation Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mmm She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, yeah Now that she's back in the atmosphere I'm afraid that she might think of me as Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

[Chorus] But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? Did you finally get the chance To dance along the light of day And head back to the Milky Way? And tell me, did Venus blow your mind? Was it everything you wanted to find? And did you miss me while you were Looking for yourself out there? 
[Bridge] Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken Your best friend always sticking up for you Even when I know you're wrong? Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance Five-hour phone conversation The best soy latte that you ever had, and me? 
[Chorus] But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? (Feet) Did you finally get the chance To dance along the light of day (Light of day) And head back toward the Milky Way? And tell me, did you sail across the sun? Did you make it to the Milky Way To see the lights all faded And that heaven is overrated? Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star? One without a permanent scar And did you miss me while you were Looking for yourself?

[Outro] Na, na, na, na, na, na Na, na, na, na, na, na And did you finally get the chance To dance along the light of day? Na, na, na, na, na, na Na, na, na, na, na, na And did you fall for a shooting star? Fall for a shooting star? Na, na, na, na, na, na Na, na, na, na, na, na And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?

[Pre-Chorus] But you know he'll always keep movin' You know he's never gonna stop movin' 'Cause he's rollin', he's the rollin' stone And when you wake up, it's a new mornin' The sun is shinin', it's a new mornin' And you're goin', you're goin' home

Lyrics:
I guess now it's time for me to give up I feel it's time Got a picture of you beside me Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup Got a fist of pure emotion Got a head of shattered dreams Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it I just want you back for good Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it You'll be right and understood Unaware but underlined I figured out this story It wasn't good But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory But that was not to be In the twist of separation you excelled at being free Can't you find a little room inside for me Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it I just want you back for good Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it You'll be right and understood And we'll be together, this time is forever We'll be fighting and forever we will be So complete in our love We will never be uncovered again Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it I just want you back for good Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it You'll be right and understood I guess now it's time, that you came back for good

On the top of the world looking down on creation And the only explanation I can find Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around Your love put me on the top of the world Top of the world Top of the world Top of the world Top of the world Top of the world Top of the world Top of the world Such a feeling coming over me now Everything I want the world to be now On top on top on top of the world I'm on the top now I'm on the top Now Top of the world

[Verse 1] I'm just a normal boy That sank when I fell overboard My ship would leave the country But I'd rather swim ashore Without a life vest, I'd be stuck again Wish I was much more masculine Maybe then I could learn to swim (Like fourteen miles away) Now floating up and down I spin, colliding into sound Like whales beneath me diving down I'm sinking to the bottom of my Everything that freaks me out The lighthouse beam has just run out I'm cold as cold as cold can be Be 
[Chrous] I want to swim away but don't know how Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean Let the waves up take me down Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah Let the rain of what I feel right now come down Let the rain come down

[Verse 2] Where is the coastguard? I keep looking each direction For a spotlight, give me something I need something for protection Maybe flotsam junk will do just fine The jetsam sunk, I'm left behind I'm treading for my life believe me (How can I keep up this breathing?) Not knowing how to think I scream aloud, begin to sink My legs and arms are broken down With envy for the solid ground I'm reaching for the life within me How can one man stop his ending? I thought of just your face Relaxed, and floated into space 
[Chorus] I want to swim away but don't know how Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean Let the waves up take me down Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah Let the rain of what I feel right now come down Let the rain come down

[Verse 3] Now waking to the sun I calculate what I had done Like jumping from the bow, yeah Just to prove that I knew how, yeah It's midnight's late reminder of The loss of her, the one I love My will to quickly end it all Set front row in my need to fall Into the ocean, end it all Into the ocean, end it all Into the ocean, end it all Into the ocean, end it all 
[Refrain] Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye) Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye) Into the ocean (goodbye), end it all (goodbye) 
[Chorus] I want to swim away but don't know how Sometimes it feels just like I'm falling in the ocean Let the waves up take me down Let the hurricane set in motion, yeah Let the rain of what I feel right now come down Let the rain come down

[Chorus] Rush out, out from the center Not like one side is any better Stand up as they bend, reaching My best theory? It’s already in me In me 
[Break] (We can feel, we can feel the air rush out) 
[Verse 3] So many questions And the answers come back unanswered Let's hold the old script It's a new twist You can feel the air...

[Chorus] Rush out, out from the center Not like one side is any better Stand up as they bend, reaching My best theory? It’s already in me 
[Bridge] In a lonely, real place Neither part nor mistake Love what you have with your time By dousing, find my true desire My threat, my appetite (My true desire) I feel the air... 
[Chorus] Rush out, out from the center Not like one side is any better Stand up as they bend, reaching My best theory? It’s already in me Rush out, out from the center Not like one side is any better Stand up as they bend, reaching My best theory? It’s already in me In me

[Verse 1] A heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun It can't trust anyone I was so sure what I needed was more Tried to shoot out the sun Days when we raged, we flew off the page Such damage was done But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew I was meant for someone 
[Chorus] So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room 'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good 
[Verse 2] Put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress In Richmond on high But I sobered up and I swore off that stuff Forever this time And the old lover's sing, "I thought it'd be me Who helped him get home" But home was a dream, one I'd never seen 'Til you came along

[Chorus] So girl, hang your dress up to dry, we ain't leavin' this room 'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through And carries this house on the stones like a piece of driftwood Cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good 
[Guitar Solo] 
[Chorus] So girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room 'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good Cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

[Chorus] Oh baby, oh baby Then it fell apart, it fell apart Oh baby, oh baby Then it fell apart, it fell apart Oh baby, oh baby Then it fell apart, it fell apart Oh baby, oh baby Like it always does, always does

[Verse 2] Extreme sounds that told me They held me down every night I didn't have much to say I didn't give up the light I closed my eyes and closed myself And closed my world and never open up to anything That could cut me at all I had to close down everything I had to close down my mind Too many things could cut me Too much can make me blind I've seen so much in so many places So many heartaches, so many faces So many dirty things You couldn't even believe 
[Pre-Chorus] I would stand in line for this There's always room in life for this

Release Date: 1978-11-20
Lyrics:
[Verse 1] On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness 'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak 
[Verse 2] He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes So, if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice" 
[Verse 3] So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy You gotta learn to play it right" 
[Chorus] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em Know when to walk away and know when to run You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done 
[Verse 4] Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin' Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep 'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

[Verse 5] And when he finished speakin' He turned back towards the window Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep 
[Chorus] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em Know when to walk away and know when to run You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done 
[Outro] You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em) Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em) Know when to walk away and know when to run You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em Know when to walk away and know when to run You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Some say love is a burning thing, that it makes a fiery ring Oh but I know love as a fading thing Just as fickle as a feather in a stream See honey, I saw love, you see it came to me It put its face up to my face so I could see Yeah, then I saw love disfigure me Into something I am not recognizing You see the cage it called; I said ‘come on in’ I will not open myself up this way again I lay my face to the soil, and all my teeth to the sand I will not lay like this for days now upon end You will not see me fall, or see me struggle to stand To be acknowledged by some touch from his gnarled hand You see the cage it called; I said ‘come on in’ I will not open myself up this way again You see the moon is bright in that treetop night I see the shadows that we cast in the cold clean light Now my feet are gold, and my heart is white And we race out on the desert plains all night See honey, I am not some broken thing I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee No my heart is gold and my feet are light And I am racing out on the desert plains all night
Some say love is a burning thing, that it makes a fiery ring Oh but I know love as a caging thing Just a killer, come to call from some awful dream Ah and all you folks, you come to see You just stand there in the glass looking at me But my heart is wild and my bones are steam And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free

[Verse 2] Reeking like a pigsty Peeling back and gagging free Flaccid ego in your hand Chokes on dry tears, can you understand? She's jeering at the shadows Sneering behind a smile Lunge and thrust to pout and pucker Into the face of the beguiled 
[Chorus] Peek-a-Boo, peek-a-Boo Peek-a-Boo, peek-a-Boo Golly jeepers, where'd you get those weepers? Peek-a-Boo, peek-a-Boo Peep show, creep show, where did you get those eyes?

[Verse 3] Strobe lights pump and flicker Dry lips crack out for more “Come bite on this rag doll, baby! That's right now hit the floor” They're sneaking out the back door She gets up from all fours Rhinestone fools and silver dollars Curdle into bitter tears 
[Chorus] Peek-a-Boo, peek-a-Boo Peek-a-Boo, peek-a-Boo Golly jeepers, where'd you get those weepers? Peek-a-Boo, peek-a-Boo Peep show, creep show, where did you get those eyes? Peek-a-Boo, peek-a-Boo Golly jeepers, where'd you get those peepers? Peek-a-Boo, peek-a-Boo Peep show, creep show, where did you get those eyes? Peek-a-Boo, peek-a-Boo Golly jeepers, where'd you get those weepers? Peek-a-Boo, peek-a-Boo Peep show, creep show, where did you get those eyes? Peek-a-Boo, peek-a-Boo Where did you get those eyes? Where did you get those eyes?

Album: Highway 61 Revisited
Release Date: 1965-08-30
Lyrics:
[Verse 1] Once upon a time you dressed so fine Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you? People call, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall" You thought they were all a-kiddin' you You used to laugh about Everybody that was hangin' out Now you don't talk so loud Now you don't seem so proud About having to be scrounging your next meal 
[Chorus] How does it feel? How does it feel? To be without a home? Like a complete unknown? Like a rolling stone? 
[Verse 2] Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street And now you’re gonna have to get used to it You say you never compromise With the mystery tramp, but now you realize He's not selling any alibis As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes And say, “Do you want to make a deal?"

[Chorus] How does it feel? How does it feel? To be on your own With no direction home A complete unknown Like a rolling stone? 
[Verse 3] Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you Never understood that it ain't no good You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat Ain't it hard when you discover that He really wasn't where it's at After he took from you everything he could steal? 
[Chorus] How does it feel? How does it feel? To hang on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone?

[Verse 4] Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made Exchangin' all precious gifts But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe You used to be so amused At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal 
[Chorus] How does it feel? Aw, how does it feel? To be on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone?

Lyrics:
I don't get many things right the first time In fact, I am told that a lot Now I know all the wrong turns The stumbles, and falls brought me here And where was I before the day That I first saw your lovely face? Now I see it everyday And I know that I am I am, I am the luckiest What if I'd been born fifty years before you In a house on the street where you live? Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike Would I know? And in a wide sea of eyes I see one pair that I recognize And I know that I am I am, I am the luckiest I love you more than I have Ever found a way to say to you Next door, there's an old man who lived to his 90's And one day, passed away in his sleep And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days And passed away
I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way To tell you that I know we belong That I know that I am I am, I am the luckiest

Lyrics:
[Verse 1] I wish that we could talk about it But there, that's the problem With someone new, I couldn't start it Too late for beginnings The little things that made me nervous Are gone in a moment I miss the way we used to argue Locked in your basement 
[Verse 2] I wake up and the phone is ringing Surprised, as it's early And that should be a perfect warning That something's a problem To tell the truth, I saw it coming The way you were breathing But nothing can prepare you for it The voice on the other end 
[Verse 3] The worst is all the lovely weather I'm stunned it's not raining The coffee isn't even bitter Because, what's the difference? There's all the work that needs to be done It's late for revision There's all the time and all the planning And songs to be finished

[Bridge] And it keeps coming and it keeps coming And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops And it keeps coming and it keeps coming And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops And it keeps coming and it keeps coming And it keeps coming and it keeps coming And it keeps coming and it keeps coming And it keeps coming 'til the day it stops 
[Verse 4] I wish that we could talk about it But there, that's the problem With someone new, I couldn't start it Too late for beginnings You're smaller than my wife imagined Surprised you were human There shouldn't be this radio silence But what are the options? 
[Chorus] When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone When someone great is gone, when someone great is gone

[Outro] We're safe for the moment Saved for the moment

[Verse 2] Dreams of his crash won’t pass, oh, how they all adored him Beauty will last when spiraled down The stars that mystify, he left them all behind And how his children cried, "He left us all behind!" 
[Chorus] Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh... 
[Bridge] What's the hook, the twist within this verbose mystery? I would gladly bet my life upon it That the ghost you love, your ray of light will fizzle out Without hope We're the empty set just floating through empty skin Ever searching for what we were promised Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

[Chorus] Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Oh-oh!

Lyrics:
[Verse 1] They're gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books To make a citizen out of you Because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you, son So they can watch all the things you do Because the drugs never work, they're gonna give you a smirk 'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds Another cog in the murder machine 
[Chorus] They said, "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me They could care less as long as someone'll bleed" So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me 
[Verse 2] The boys and girls in the clique, the awful names that they stick You're never gonna fit in much, kid But if you're troubled and hurt, what you got under your shirt Will make them pay for the things that they did 
[Chorus] They said, "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me They could care less as long as someone'll bleed" So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me, oh, yeah

[Guitar Solo] 
[Bridge] They said, "All teenagers scare the living shit out of me They could care less as long as someone'll bleed" So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me All together now 
[Chorus] "Teenagers scare the living shit out of me They could care less as long as someone'll bleed" So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me "Teenagers scare the living shit out of me They could care less as long as someone'll bleed" So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

[Verse 2] Night, night of matter Black flowers blossom Fearless on my breath Black flowers blossom Fearless on my breath 
[Chorus] Teardrop on the fire Fearless on my 
[Verse 3] Water is my eye Most faithful mirror Fearless on my breath Teardrop on the fire Of a confession Fearless on my breath Most faithful mirror Fearless on my breath

[Chorus] Teardrop on the fire Fearless on my breath

Lyrics:
[Verse 1] I feel a hot wind on my shoulder And the touch of a world that is older I turn the switch and check the number I leave it on when in bed I slumber I hear the rhythms of the music I buy the product and never use it I hear the talking of the DJ Can't understand, just what does he say? 
[Chorus] I'm on a Mexican radio I'm on a Mexican whoa-oa radio 
[Post-Chorus] 
[faint sound of a radio announcer speaking in Spanish] 
[Verse 2] I dial it in and tune the station They talk about the U.S. inflation I understand just a little No comprende, it's a riddle 
[Chorus] I'm on a Mexican radio I'm on a Mexican whoa-oa radio
I'm on a Mexican radio I'm on a Mexican whoa-oa radio 
[Post-Chorus] 
[lip buzzing (exhalation through slightly parted lips to cause a vibration)] 
[faint sound of a radio announcer speaking in Spanish] 
[Verse 3] I wish I was in Tijuana Eating barbecued iguana I took requests on the telephone I'm on a wavelength far from home I feel a hot wind on my shoulder I dial it in from south of the border I hear the talking of the DJ Can't understand, just what does he say? 
[Chorus] I'm on a Mexican radio I'm on a Mexican whoa-oa radio I'm on a Mexican radio I'm on a Mexican whoa-oa radio

[Bridge] Radio, radio Radio, radio Radio, radio Radio, radio 
[Chorus] I'm on a Mexican radio I'm on a Mexican whoa-oa radio I'm on a Mexican radio I'm on a Mexican whoa-oa radio

[faint sound of a radio announcer speaking in Spanish] 
[Outro] Radio, radio (What does he say?) Radio, radio 
[faint sound of a radio announcer speaking in Spanish] Radio, radio Radio, radio
