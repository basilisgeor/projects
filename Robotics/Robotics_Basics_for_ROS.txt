other stuff shown in the tutorial (at ecourse) for listeners and stuff
more can be found in the ros.org in the tutorials segment

‚û°Ô∏èü§ñÔ∏èTo Run Athe Turtlebot In Gazebo Or Rviz Do ü§ñÔ∏è:
	i) cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
	ii) source /home/vaggst/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
	iii) roslaunch turtlebot3_fake turtlebot3_fake.launch (FOR RVIZ)
		a)roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
	iv)roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch (FOR GAZEBO)
		
		
‚û°Ô∏èAdd velocity to the robot : 
	after the launch -----> on a second terminal 
	i) rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist -r 10 -- '[0.0,0.0,0.0]' '[0.0,0.0,0.0]' 
	the 2 arrays are one for the xyz velocity and other for the xyz rotation ! 
	+ or - for direction and number for the robots velocity ! 
	
	
‚û°Ô∏èRobot Steering mechaninsm 
	new terminal while running a cmd_vel command 	
	command : $rqt 
	Plugins->Robot Tools -> Robot Steering ! 
	and you can make the robot do whatever with the 2 sliders ! 	
	
	
‚û°Ô∏èTo run a script with the movement:  
	for the starting set up of the appropriate files and pkg follow the intractions : http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim/Tutorials/Moving%20in%20a%20Straight%20Line
	Terminal 1 : roscore
	Terminal 2 : line 22 stuff for gazebo ! 
	Terminal 3 : in file ~/catkin_ws/src 
		     i) source /home/vaggst/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
		     ii) rosrun turtlebot3_cleaner move.py
	where move.py python code in turtlebot3_cleaner/src directory with the code to make the turtlebot3 move ! 
!!!!!!!!!!! A python error solved with command :  sudo apt-get install python-is-python3 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
