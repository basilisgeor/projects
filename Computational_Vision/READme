### Assignment 1

**Title:** Basic Image Processing and Convolution  
**Date:** April 2023

#### Description
In this assignment, we explore basic image processing techniques, focusing on:
- Reading and displaying images using Python libraries.
- Implementing image convolution manually without using built-in functions.
- Applying various filters to images and visualizing the results.

#### Key Components
- **Image Loading and Display:** Use of libraries like `skimage` and `matplotlib` for handling image data.
- **Zero Padding:** Implementation of zero-padding function to prepare images for convolution.
- **Convolution Operation:** Manual implementation of the convolution operation, followed by applying different kernels to the images.

#### Files
- `assignment1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for Assignment 1.
- `assignment1.pdf`: PDF export of the Jupyter Notebook.

### Assignment 2

**Title:** Advanced Image Filtering and Effects  
**Date:** May 2023

#### Description
This assignment delves deeper into image filtering techniques, focusing on:
- Implementing advanced convolution operations.
- Applying Gaussian and other filters to achieve effects like blurring and sharpening.
- Understanding and implementing edge detection algorithms.

#### Key Components
- **Advanced Convolution:** Building on the previous assignment to handle more complex filters.
- **Gaussian Filtering:** Applying Gaussian filters for image blurring.
- **Edge Detection:** Implementing and applying Sobel and other edge detection filters.

**Title:** Image Segmentation and Feature Extraction  
**Date:** June 2023

#### Description
The final assignment focuses on segmentation and feature extraction, including:
- Implementing image segmentation algorithms.
- Extracting and analyzing image features.
- Applying clustering techniques to segment images.

#### Key Components
- **Image Segmentation:** Techniques like thresholding and k-means clustering for segmenting images.
- **Feature Extraction:** Identifying and extracting important features from images.
- **Clustering:** Using clustering algorithms to group similar pixels and segments in images.

#### Files
